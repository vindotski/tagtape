# TagTape — agent instructions

TagTape turns 1–10 YouTube links plus album details (title, artist, genre, year, cover) into a ZIP of ID3-tagged MP3s laid out as an album, so the tracks sort and display correctly on any plain MP3 player. It is stateless: no accounts, no database. https://tagtape.app

## Repo layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `legacy/` | Original Symfony/PHP app. **Read-only reference**: never edit, build, or lint it. |
| `src/`, `vite.config.ts` | TanStack Start web app (moving to `apps/web/`). |
| `apps/api/` *(planned)* | Fastify 5 service that runs yt-dlp + ffmpeg, tags, zips, as background jobs. |
| `packages/shared/` *(planned)* | zod schemas and types shared by web and API (`@tagtape/shared`). |

How the parts talk to each other: the browser calls TanStack Start **server functions**, and those call the API over a private network with a bearer token. The only route the browser hits directly is the ZIP download, `GET /jobs/:id/archive`.

## Commands (pnpm only)

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev        # web app on http://localhost:3000
pnpm build
pnpm check      # Biome lint + format (use `pnpm exec biome check --write` to fix)
```

Run `pnpm check` and the relevant tests before calling a task done.

## Conventions

- **Biome** is the only linter and formatter. Don't add ESLint or Prettier.
- **TypeScript strict.** Validate input with **zod** schemas from `@tagtape/shared`, and use the same schema on the client and the server.
- **External binaries** (yt-dlp, ffmpeg) are spawned with an **argument array, never a shell string**. The legacy app had a shell injection bug from building a command string.
- Only accept YouTube URLs, normalised by the shared parser. Fetch remote images with a size cap, a timeout, and private-IP blocking (SSRF).
- Jobs are in-memory, and their temp files are cleaned up by a TTL sweeper. Don't add persistence without asking.
- pnpm settings live in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. `.npmrc` is for auth only (see the `pnpm` skill).

## Git

- **The user makes all commits.** Never run `git commit` or `git push`. When a step is done, suggest a commit message with the `commit-message` skill.
- Work is done one step at a time, and each step is one commit.

## Skills

Project skills are in `.claude/skills/` (tracked by `skills-lock.json`): `fastify-best-practices`, `node`, `pnpm`, `vitest`, `commit-message`. TanStack's version-matched skills load through TanStack Intent (block below).
